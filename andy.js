// JavaScript Function Exercises

// 1. Define a function called "divideByTwo". It should accept one parameter called "number".
//    The function should divide the number by two and output the answer.

var divideByTwo = function(number) {
  console.log(number/2);
};
divideByTwo(8);

// 2. Define a function called "greeting". It should accept two parameters, which will be names.
//    The function should output the a greeting to both people.

var greeting = function(a,b) {
  console.log("Yo"+ a +" and " + b);
};
greeting("Joe","John");

// 3. You use Amazon Subscribe & Save to have six cans of cashews automatically sent to you each month, but the price keeps changing.
//    Write a function that takes the price per unit and calculates the total for you each month.

var ppu = function(price) {
return price * 6;
};
ppu(3.33);


// 4. Write a function that accepts the following array and separates the people into two teams.
//    No names next to eachother in the array should be on the same team.

console.log("Question 4");
var teammates = ["Harold", "Bob", "Sue", "Grady", "Notorious B.I.G.",
 "JavaCrypt", "Weird guy in the back", "Gary", "Carol", "Hipster Tim", "Janet"];

      var team1 =[];
      var team2 =[];
      var teams = function(a) {
      for(i=0; i<teammates.length; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
     team1.push(teammates[i]);
    }
     else {
       team2.push(teammates[i]);
               }
        }
    };
teams();
console.log(team1 + "\n" + team2);


// 5. Define a function called "quarter". It accepts one parameter called "number".
//    The function will return a value which is one quarter of the number provided.
//    Call the function inside of a conditional statement that prints one statement if the value is even or another statement if the value is odd.
//    In pseudocode:
//                  defining my function here(parameter)
//                      returns a value that divides that parameter by 4
//
//                  if (calling the function with parameter divided by 2 is even)
//                      print out a statement saying the number is even
//                  else
//                      print out a statement saying the number is odd

var quarter = function(number) {
  var z = number/4;
  if (z % 2 === 0) {
    return "The number is even";
  }
  else {
    return "The number is odd";
  }
};

console.log(quarter(8));


// 6. Define functions called "area" and "perimeter". They should both accept two parameters and calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

var area = function(x,y) {
z = x*y;
return "The area of the rectangle is " +z;
};

var perimeter = function(a,b) {
z = 2*(a + b);
return "The perimeter of the rectangle is " +z;
};

console.log(area(3,2));
console.log(perimeter(1,1));


// 7. Write a function called "sleepings", it should accept one parameter, an integer called "hours".
//    Write a conditional statement inside of the function. If the number of hours is more than 8, print a statement to the console about getting enough rest.
//    If the number of hours is less than 8, print a statement recommending the user get more shut eye.

var sleepings = function(hours) {
if (hours >= 8) {console.log("You got plenty of sleep, now get to work.");}
else {console.log("Get some more shut eye");}
};
sleepings(9);


// 8. Prompt a user to enter a six digit number. Write a function that reverses the number.
//    (Hint, you will have to turn the integer into a string before you can reverse it.)

var sixdig = prompt("Enter a six digit number");
var change = function(c) {
var b = c.toString().split('').reverse().join('');
console.log(b);
};
change(sixdig);


// 9. Within the fuction you wrote in #7, write a conditional statement that checks to ensure the user entered a six digit integer.
//    If they have not entered a six digit integer, give them a message about being a failure.

var sixdig = prompt("Enter a six digit number");
if (sixdig.length != 6) {
  console.log("Enter six numbers bro");
}

// 10. You've finally gotten around to counting the change in your piggy bank. Write a function that accepts four parameters (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies).
//     The function should take each number of coins and multiply it times each coin's value.
//     Finally, it should return the total amount of change you have in the following format: "$32.77"

var countMoney = function(quarters,dimes,nickels,pennies) {
  var total = (quarters*25 + dimes*10 + nickels*5 + pennies);
  console.log("$" + (total/100).toFixed(2));
};
countMoney(9,2,11,2);


// 11. Develop a function that determines a person's age by prompting them for their birth year.

var d = new Date();
var thisYear = d.getFullYear();
var birthYear = prompt("Please enter your Birth Year");
if (birthYear > thisYear) {
  console.log("Impossible, try again");
  var birthYear = prompt("Please enter your Birth Year");
}

var age = function() {
console.log ("You Are " thisYear - birthYear " years old." )

}
age(birthYear);

// 12. Write a function that takes a year and reports whether or not it is a leap year.
//     Remember, a leap year occurs:
//        On every year that is evenly divisible by 4
//        Except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
//        Unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
//        For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  1900 is not a leapyear, but 2000 is

var leapYear = prompt("Enter a 4 digit year");
var leapCheck = function(y) {
  if ((y % 100 === 0) && (y % 400 === 0)) {
    console.log(y+ " IS A LEAP YEAR");
  }
else if (y % 100 === 0) {
  console.log(y+ " is not a leap year");
}
else if ( y % 4 === 0) {
    console.log(y+ " is a leap year");
     }
else {
console.log(y+ " is not a leap year");
}
};
leapCheck(leapYear);

// 13. Develop a function that cleans up a phone number entered by a user.
//     The rules are as follows:
//        If the phone number is less than 10 digits assume that it is bad number
//        If the phone number is 10 digits assume that it is good
//        If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is 1, trim the 1 and use the last 10 digits
//        If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is not 1, then it is a bad number
//        If the phone number is more than 11 digits assume that it is a bad number

var phone = prompt("Enter Your Phone #");
var phoneNoHyphen = phone.replace(/-/g,"");
var cleanUp = function(a) {
  if ((a.length < 10) || (a.length > 11)) {
    alert("bad number");
    console.log(a+ "condition 1");
  }
  else if ((a.length == 11) && (a.charAt(0) == 1)) {
    a = a.slice(1);
    console.log(a+ "condition 2");
  }
  else if ((a.length == 11) && (a.charAt(0) !== 1)) {
    alert("bad number");
    console.log(a+ "condition 3");
  }
  else {
    console.log(a+ "condition 4");
  }
};
cleanUp(phoneNoHyphen);


// 14. Create a function that determines whether a parameter is a number or not (Hint: google "isNan")
//     Iterate over the elements in the following array to determine if each is a number.

var arrayOfAllTheThings = ["one", 23, {thingsWhalesLove: "beaches"}, "six hundred", 33, 6834, "5,435"];
var isNumber = function(x) {
  for (i=0; i<x.length; i++) {
    var numberTest = isNaN(x[i]);
    if (numberTest === false) {
      console.log(x[i] + " Is a number");
    }
    else {console.log (x[i] + " Is not a number");
  }
  }
};
isNumber(arrayOfAllTheThings);




// 15. Create a die rolling function that accepts two parameters (the two six-sided dice) and outputs an array of the two values rolled.

var die1 =  Math.floor(Math.random()*6 + 1);
var die2 =  Math.floor(Math.random()*6 + 1);
var dieThrow =[];
var die = function(x,y) {
dieThrow = [x,y];
 };
die(die1,die2);
console.log(dieThrow);

// 16. Create another fuction called "whichSide". It will accept the array from above as it's only parameter.
//     This function will mimic a Monopoly board. Start playerOne at the Go space (0) and add the two values from your die array to determine
//     how many spaces the player will move. Log to the console which side of the board the player is on.
//     Hint: each side has 11 spaces. You can call the sides of the board: north, east, south, west or top, right, bottom, left.

// 17. Using the game above, use the same function(s) and add additional code to determine if the player is on a corner spot.
//     Log to the console which corner the player is located.
